# TODO List for Newsletter Signup Form Implementation

- [x] Update src/__tests__/App.test.js: Add import for userEvent, fill in all test functions with proper assertions for form elements, initial state, user interactions, and submit behavior.
- [x] Run npm test to confirm tests fail initially (code not implemented yet).
- [x] Update src/App.js: Add useState hooks for form state (name, email, interests, submitted, message), add form JSX with inputs, checkboxes, and submit button, implement event handlers for typing, checkbox clicks, and form submission.
- [x] Run npm test again to verify all tests pass after implementation.
- [ ] If tests fail or issues arise, adjust code/tests accordingly.
